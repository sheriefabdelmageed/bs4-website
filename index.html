                  Pluto also orbits (though it's a irregular orbit around the
                  sun).

                  Should clear out it's own orbit (e.g. not have asteroids
                  flying around it).
                </td>
                <td>
                  This is the one that nullified Pluto because its moons can be
                  small, but in that spirit, not sure that Jupiter or Saturn
                  should be a planet. Hrmph...
